# BBDSAL

Big Brain Data Structure Algorithm Learning (horrible name, right?!, love it)

# What is it?

As someone who needs to improve at algos and data structures, I want to be able
to have something pick the topics and generate all the boiler plate code but
leave the real work up to me.

So, that is exactly what BBDSAL does. It currently offers 19 different algorithms
and data structures, of which it randomly generates however many you want. (You
give it the amount you want to do).

And, best of all, IT GENERATES C BOILER PLATE!!! Yes, C, you have to actually be
able to write some code yourself! Much better this way.

# Usage

Clone the repository and cd into project directory

```
git clone https://github.com/huttongrabiel/bbdsal.git
cd /path/to/bbdsal
```

Once in the root directory do:
```
cargo run
```

It will then generate the boilerplate code and place it in the file bbdsalPractice.

```
cd bbdsalPractice
```

Write some code and run it using clang or gcc, up to you, I tested with gcc.

Have fun!
